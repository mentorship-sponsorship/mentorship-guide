# Where/when can I mentor?

## üó∫ Where to mentor

Mentorship can occur anywhere. It can be in your ...

* organization/company
* team
* local communities
* online

You can think of it as an onion, peeling back different layers:

* self &gt; team &gt; department &gt; organization &gt; industry
* it can take place in physical locations
* can happen online/remotely

## üîç Finding mentees

### ‚û° I go to them

You're the one taking the first step and initiative. Sometimes, people want to reach out, but feel uncomfortable/shy. Or they don't want to inconvenience. Similarly, they may not know who is willing to share.

Taking the initiative, you can mentor at:

* schools
* meetups
* conferences
* hackathons
* internal events
* organizations

More details coming soon.

### ‚¨Ö They come to me

You can be a like a lighthouse, signaling to others, "Hi, I'm here, feel free to reach out!"

For example:

* posting a welcoming message \(with what type of info to ask\), on your
  * social media, Twitter pinned tweet/bio
  * LinkedIn summary
  * personal site/blog

For those with large followings, there are ways to manage with filters, email aliases, and more. More details to come.

## ‚è∞ When to mentor

We have families, friends, hobbies, and other responsibilities. How do you fit mentorship in too?

It doesn‚Äôt have to be time consuming.

* It can be an hour a month
* 10 minutes over a span of many months

Be mindful of when you can help, and then do it. Stay flexible and adaptable as your schedule changes.

### üìù Examples

**The email** 

I enjoy business, product, data, psychology, tech and people. Awhile back, I reached out to an alumnus for career advice. He‚Äôs a busy individual, a co founder of a SaaS company. He replied with a lengthy email. There were follow-up questions, his opinions, and assumptions, and insights from his experience.

We never had a phone call. Or met in person. But that email exchange had an impact.

Time is not equal. I estimate that it took him about an hour to write that email. But at the same time, it easily saved me a few weeks worth of mine.
