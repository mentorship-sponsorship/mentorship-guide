# When to mentor

## When to mentor

We have families, friends, hobbies, and other responsibilities. How do you fit mentorship in too?

It doesn’t have to be time consuming.

* It can be an hour a month
* 10 minutes over a span of many months

Be mindful of when you can help, and then do it. Stay flexible and adaptable as your schedule changes.

### Examples

**The email** 

I enjoy business, product, data, psychology, tech and people. Awhile back, I reached out to an alumnus for career advice. He’s a busy individual, a co founder of a SaaS company. He replied with a lengthy email. There were follow-up questions, his opinions, and assumptions, and insights from his experience.

We never had a phone call. Or met in person. But that email exchange had an impact.

Time is not equal. I estimate that it took him about an hour to write that email. But at the same time, it easily saved me a few weeks worth of mine.
