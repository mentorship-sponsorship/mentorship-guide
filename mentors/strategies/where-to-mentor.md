# Where to mentor

## Where to mentor

Mentorship can occur anywhere. It can be in your ...

* organization/company
* team
* local communities
* online

You can think of it as an onion, peeling back different layers:

* self &gt; team &gt; department &gt; organization &gt; industry
* it can take place in physical locations
* can happen online/remotely

## Finding mentees

### I go to them

You're the one taking the first step and initiative. Sometimes, people want to reach out, but feel uncomfortable/shy. Or they don't want to inconvenience. Similarly, they may not know who is willing to share.

Taking the initiative, you can mentor at:

* schools
* meetups
* conferences
* hackathons
* internal events
* organizations

More details coming soon.

### They come to me

You can be a like a lighthouse, signaling to others, "Hi, I'm here, feel free to reach out!"

For example:

* posting a welcoming message \(with what type of info to ask\), on your
  * social media, Twitter pinned tweet/bio
  * LinkedIn summary
  * personal site/blog

For those with large followings, there are ways to manage with filters, email aliases, and more. More details to come.
