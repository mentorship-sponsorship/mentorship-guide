**Gratitude**

Thanks to mentors, I am where I am today. Their guidance and encouragement has been invaluable.

**Generational impact**

In benefiting someone's life, you've now helped their family, friends, and community. Small or large, you've positively contributed to future generations. It's a ripple effect.
