## Advice from mentees

> Please add more :\)

**It's okay to not know all the answers**

It may seem like you have to know everything or be prepared for anything a mentee asks. In reality, you don't have to. Just your willingness to hear us and try to help is more than enough! If you do not know, then we can brainstorm together. Or if we refine the question, we can reach out to other people and resources to gain more insight.
