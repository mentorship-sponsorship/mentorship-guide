#### **Gratitude**

"Thanks to mentors, I am where I am today. Their guidance and encouragement has been invaluable."

#### **Generational impact**

"In helping someone's, you've now helped their family, friends, and community. Small or large, you've positively contributed to future generations. It's a ripple effect." - Guedis
