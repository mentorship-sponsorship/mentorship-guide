Paying it forward benefits you as well.

* learn more about yourself
* expand your world view
* make a new friend, ally, supporter
* feel good about giving back
* find knowledge gaps in your own thinking
* learn something new

Hearing other people's stories and perspectives, makes your own that much more richer, dynamic, and inclusive.&#x20;

There are valuable feelings and experiences that money cannot buy, but that only mentorship can provide.

## :heartpulse: It helps the broader community

> "A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle" (James Keller)

What we put in, we get out. Collectively, we can do our part in fostering a more inclusive, collaborative, and innovative community.

We are raising the waters so that we're all uplifted. It's a ripple effect. We help someone and they help someone and it continues.

Before you know it, it's like a boomerang of help that returns to you.
